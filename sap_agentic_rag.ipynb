        "\n",
        "n retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), splitting large documents into smaller chunks is essential for efficient retrieval and better generation. Here's why:\n",
        "# New\n",
        "1. Memory Constraints: Large documents can be too big to process all at once in memory. Splitting into smaller, manageable chunks ensures the system can handle them efficiently.\n",
        "2. Improved Retrieval: Splitting allows the retrieval engine to match relevant sections more accurately, rather than considering an entire large document.\n",
        "3. Maintaining Context with Overlap: When splitting, overlaps between chunks help preserve context. This is important because the boundary of one chunk might split a coherent idea. The overlap helps ensure that the retrieval engine doesn’t lose important information that might span two chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Chunking Strategies\n",
        "1. Fixed Size Chunking\n",
        "Splits text into fixed-sized chunks based on tokens or characters.\n",
        "Positives: Simple and easy to implement.\n",
        "Negatives: Often breaks sentences or paragraphs, leading to incomplete context.\n",
        "2. Sliding window Approch\n",
        "Moves a fixed-size window across the text, creating overlapping chunks.\n",
        "Positives: Maintains context across chunks.\n",
        "Negatives: Introduces redundancy, increasing computational overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Recursive Splitting\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Divides text at semantic or structural boundaries like sentences or paragraphs.\n",
        "*   Positives: Preserves meaning by aligning chunks with natural breaks.\n",
        "*   Negatives: Computationally intensive and requires advanced parsing techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "Selecting the right chunking strategy is vital for the accuracy in outputof LLM-based applications. Fixed-size chunking offers simplicity but may lose meaning. Sliding windows maintain continuity but add redundancy. Recursive splitting ensures semantic integrity but requires careful implementation.\n",

According to \\nSAP’s sustainability strategy, you should only go on business trips if they are unavoidable. \\nFirst consider alternatives such as videoconferencing. Take into account the overall cost of \\nthe trip and ensure that travel expenditure decisions are made in the best interest of SAP \\nand its customers. Non-compliance with the Global Travel Policy may result in disciplinary \\nmeasures.  You can find more information, such as booking channels, in SAP Corporate \\nPortal at quick link . \\nBusiness Trip Definition \\nBusiness trips are journeys to locations other than your regular place of work and home that \\nfulfill a business purpose. If you set out on a business trip from home, the trip begins as soon \\nas you leave the house. If you set out on a business trip from work, the trip begins as soon \\nas you leave the company’s premises. \\n \\n1 TRAVEL PLANNING \\n▪ If economically reasonable, you should choose the most environmentally friendly \\ntransportation for business trips. \\n▪ If you have a medical condition and a certificate issued by an external medical \\nprofessional, SAP advises you not to travel.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creationdate': '2023-10-13T07:56:38+02:00', 'author': 'Stoehr, Iris', 'moddate': '2023-10-13T07:56:38+02:00', 'source': 'GlobalTravelPolicy (English).pdf', 'total_pages': 10, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='▪ If you have a medical condition and a certificate issued by an external medical \\nprofessional, SAP advises you not to travel. \\n▪ You must align with your manager or the cost object owner (cost center, internal \\norder, WBS element, sales order) about your planned trips before you book. \\n▪ All travel must be within existing budgets. \\n▪ If you need to stay over the weekend for business reasons, the same regulations as \\nstated in this document apply. \\n▪ If a business trip includes private elements you have to bear any additional costs that \\nare incurred.

        "Semantic search helps in retrieving documents that are semantically similar to a query, not just those with exact keyword matches. Common distance functions used in semantic search are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. L2 (Euclidean) Distance:\n",
        "Measures the straight-line distance between two points (vectors). It's commonly used in geometric contexts but may not capture similarity well in high-dimensional spaces. When to use: • Image search and spatial data: L2 distance is often used when the data represents physical space or continuous attributes, such as in image search or geographical location data. In these cases, the exact “distance” between two points in the vector space is meaningful.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Cosine Similarity:\n",
        "Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. This is often used in text retrieval tasks because it focuses on the direction rather than the magnitude of the vectors. When to use: • Text-based retrieval: Cosine similarity works well in natural language processing tasks, where the direction of the vector (representing the semantics of the text) matters more than its magnitude. • Document clustering: When clustering text documents or searching for documents with similar topics, cosine similarity helps retrieve semantically related information even if the length of the documents varies.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Other possible distance measures include:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Manhattan Distance: Based on the sum of absolute differences. It works well when comparing structured (tabular) data with features that are unrelated or only loosely related.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   List item: Measures the intersection over union of sets of tokens. Jaccard similarity is ideal for tasks where you compare sets of elements, such as keyword sets, tags, or lists. It measures how similar two sets are based on shared elements.\n",

        "NumPy's dot product function is a mathematical operation that takes two arrays of the same length and multiplies corresponding elements, followed by adding those products. In the context of comparing embeddings, it's extremely useful because it can measure the cosine similarity between two vectors when they're normalized. When embeddings (high-dimensional vectors that represent text) are compared, the angle between them can signify the degree of similarity. Smaller angles indicate more similar embeddings and larger angles suggest less similarity. By using the dot product, we effectively measure the cosine of the angle between two embeddings, giving us a quantifiable measure of their similarity. This is key in many natural language processing tasks, such as searching for documents similar to a given query in a large corpus.\n"
